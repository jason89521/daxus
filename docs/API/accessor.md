# Accessor

accessors are generated by model's [`defineAccessor`](./createModel.md#defineaccessor). They are used to fetch the data from your server, and then synchronize the data to the model.

```ts
const { revalidate, setIsStale } = normalAccessor;

const { revalidate, setIsStale, fetchNext } = infiniteAccessor;
```

## `revalidate`

Fetch the data from the server, and then synchronize it to the model.

## `setIsStale`

Set the data, for which the accessor is responsible for fetching, to stale.

## `fetchNext`

Only the instance of the `InfiniteAccessor` has this method. This method would fetch the next page. If there is an revalidation, invoking `fetchNext` will interrupt it.
